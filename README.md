# RSPM #
This project documents the development of a framework for building collaborative disaggregate strategic planning models. The working name is the RSPM framework. RSPM stands for Regional Strategic Planning Model. This is the metropolitan version of the Oregon Department of Transportation's [GreenSTEP model](https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP/pages/greenstep.aspx) which was built to evaluate the potential for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from light duty vehicles in various ways. Although the initial purpose of GreenSTEP was to estimate the effects of various actions on GHG emissions, it has been found to be useful for other strategic transportation planning purposes. The RSPM name was adopted to indicate the broader uses to which the model may be put. GreenSTEP or parts of GreenSTEP have been spun off into other models as well. These include the U.S. Department of Transportation's Energy and Emissions Reduction Policy Analysis Tool (EERPAT) and Rapid Policy Assessment Tool (RPAT).  

All of these models belong to a class of models that are being called disaggregate strategic planning models. They are disaggregate because, like many modern transportation models, they simulate behavior at the individual household level rather than at a more aggregate 'zonal' level. This enables the assessment of how prospective policies or other changes could have different impacts on different types of households (e.g. low income vs. high income).  

The models are strategic planning models because they are built to support long-range strategic planning decisions such as community visioning, policy development, and scenario planning. Strategic planning processes most often need to consider a number of possibilities about how the future may unfold and a range of potential actions that might be taken. As a consequence, models built to support strategic planning need to be responsive to a large number of variables and be capable of running quickly so that a large number of runs can be done to explore the decision space. This [webpage](https://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/TD/TP/Pages/scenarioviewer.html) shows one example of the exploration of the potential for reducing GHG emissions from light-duty vehicle travel in a small metropolitan area. To meet the needs of strategic planning, these models favor breadth over depth of analysis.  

Although the structure of GreenSTEP has been good enough to enable the creation of a number of related models, it is not sufficient to enable the improvements to one of the model branches to be easily shared with the other branches. Model improvements and new modules aren't easily incorporated into the existing models. In addition, the structure doesn't make it easy for additional modelers to collaborate to add new modules or improve existing modules. 

The goal of this project to to create a new programming framework for the RSPM, GreenSTEP and related models that provides common services and establishes an API for developing model modules that can operate within the framework. In addition, the project will develop several demonstration modules for the framework and will include documentation to guide future module developers. 

This framework, like the RSPM and GreenSTEP, will be coded in the [R  language](http://www.r-project.org). There are several reasons for this. First, since the R language is an exemplary language for data analysis and statistical programming, it is well suited for model development. Using R facilitates the development of models that are open and replicable. Second, since R is a full-featured programming language, it can be used very efficiently in model development because all the steps of data processing, exploratory data analysis, model estimation, model implementation, and output visualization can be done in one language. Third, R has a very good system for package development and management which facilitates the creation and sharing of model modules. Finally, R can be interfaced with higher performance languages like C++ (although most often very acceptable performance can be achieve with R itself if properly used).  

This GitHub project addresses the design of the RSPM framework, specifications, API, and documentation of the framework. The 'approach' directory contains documents which give an overview of the project including background, rationale and approach. The 'api' directory contains documents which detail the framework specifications and application programming interface. The 'design' directory contains documents which describe the design of the RSPM framework. The 'manuals' directory contains documentation on how to use the framework. Finally, the RSPM framework code and example module code will be added later. These will be in the form of R packages.
