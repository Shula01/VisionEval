Description: This package contains several models which create a set of
    synthetic households and attribute them with income and location
    attributes. The first model synthesizes households from from a forecast
	of population in each of six age groups (0-14, 15-19, 20-29, 30-54, 55-64,
	65+). The second model assigns household income based on the household
	age composition and the average per capita income for the division the
	household is located in. The third model assigns a district and housing
	type to the household. Key parameters for each model are estimated using
	data for the region being modeled. The user should start with the source
	package and read the documentation for instructions on gathering and
	formatting data needed to estimate the key parameters. Then the user will
	follow instructions on processing the package to create the binary
	version that will be used in model implementation.
